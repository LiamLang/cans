# Cans
This program calculates the optimum way to build a hexagonal tower out of a large number of empty cans, or other cylindrical objects.
Layers are repeated so that all cans will be used.
Groups of three are added just below the top for a more pleasing result.
Results are displayed using text and primitive ASCII art.
